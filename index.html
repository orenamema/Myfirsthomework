                    I'm a huge tennis fan and I love to travel and eat good food.</br> 
                    I have been to over 20 countries and lived in 4 different continents</br> 
                    I speak french, portuguese, spanish, english  and I love learning new languages.</br> 

                    I love to play tennis and watch my favorite players in person or on TV. </br> 
                    My favorite surface is clay because it's a stylish way to play. </br> 
               
                    My favorite tennis player is Rafael Nadal not only because he's a great athlete</br>  
                    but he's a role model for perseverence and hard work. My 2 favorite Grand Slam</br> 
                    tournements are the US Open and Roland Garros.</br>
