### Introduction

This is my first homework

We will have 3 pages
1. Page 1
2. Page 2
3. Page 3

I’ve worked on this first assignment using the different tools that were available to us such as the course content, the online videos, W3Schools and our instructors. I was able to create 3 pages linked to each other using VS Code. I’ve spent most of the time on the first page since it was the one that would be the base of the website.

I have used the course concepts of divs to separate the content on the page. I’ve selected a background image as we were instructed and added it to my page. I had to play around with the size of the different boxes on the page so that it could match the assignment. I’ve added all the pictures that I would be using in the images folder.
